DeepWindow: sliding window based on deep learning for road extraction in remote sensing images

Abstract:For tracking the road network in remote sensing images, the template matching methods are commonly applied. However, the matching rules are manually specified in the traditional template matching methods which may make the extracted road center line deviated from the road center in complex cases and even result in overall tracking errors. In order to overcome this problem, this paper presents road extraction algorithm based on a road center points estimation model. In our method, the tracking seeds are automatically searched, which get rid of the artificial intervention and makes the process of road tracking process fully automated combing with the road direction estimation. Most importantly, our method directly extracts the road network from images without the guidance of road segmentation, which greatly enhances the method effectiveness and reduces the cost of model training. Extensive and comprehensive experiments performed on the extraction of roads and retinal vessels indicate that our method is effective and can be applied for tracking topology in other scenes.
